## Managing your PhD

This is a repository of tools and resources for organizing and managing the PhD process to compliment the presentation: [Managing Your PhD](https://github.com/pete-lawson/managing-your-phd/raw/main/resources/managing-your-phd.pdf). 

### Managing Literature Reviews

#### Reference Manager

Over the course of your PhD you will read, review, and collect a large body of literature that you will need to keep organized. Using a reference manager is the best way to do this.

Common reference managers include:

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
